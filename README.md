# [CSCI 4100 Machine Learning from Data](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~magdon/courses/learn.php)

My coursework for RPI's Machine Learning course. 

LFD (Learning From Data) is the class textbook

## Overview

Introduction to the theory, algorithms, and applications of machine learning (supervised, reinforcement, and unsupervised) from data: What is learning? Is learning feasible? How can we do it? How can we do it well? The course offers a mix of theory, technique, and application with additional selected topics chosen from Pattern Recognition, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, RBFâ€™s, Bayesian Learning, PAC Learning, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian processes, and Hidden Markov Models.
