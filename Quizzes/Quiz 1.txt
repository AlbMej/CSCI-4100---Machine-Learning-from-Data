Define a Tree

    A tree has a relatively long (proportional to its other parts) single trunk. The trunk looks to be made out of a woody substance called bark. Bark is typically of a darker color like grey or a reddish-brown but it could also be of other colors like white. Regardless the color, the bark of a tree is to be a rough and uneven surface with the blemishes that sometimes differ in color/texture as the rest of the trunk; these blemishes can be wrinkle like creases in the trunk or spots that look like open wounds on skin. Trees usually have something called leaves or branches. You know a if a tree has branches if you see the same bark-y like structure sticking out of the trunk. Branches usually occur at the top of the tree but can appear all over the trunk in some trees. However, branches are very thin and small in comparison to the trunk of the tree. Leaves can also grow out of the tree but usually are found sticking off of the branches. Leaves are typically a lighter color than the trunk, they are usually green, red, brown, yellow or a mixture of colors. Leaves come in a variety of shapes and in most cases are symmetrical. They can be thin, straight, pointy, and tough like a pencil but they can also be thin and wide compared to branches.
